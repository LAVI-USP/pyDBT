pyDBT
======

This repository is a python extension of the [DBT toolbox](https://github.com/LAVI-USP/DBT-Reconstruction) from LAVI-USP. 



## How to install?

 1. Download the toolbox or clone the directory:
    
    * ```git clone https://github.com/LAVI-USP/pyDBT.git```

 2. Go to parent directory:

    * ```cd pyDBT```

 3. Clone NVIDIA cuda-samples directory inside pyDBT:
    
    * ```git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-samples```

 3. Install the package:

    * ```python3 setup.py install```

 3. If you have problems with `arch=sm_XX`, modify it in the `setup.py` accordingly to your NVIDIA-GPU architecture. This [link](https://arnon.dk/matching-sm-architectures-arch-and-gencode-for-various-nvidia-cards/) has some references.

 4. run the example:

    * ```cd pydbt && python3 example.py```
 
 5. The toolbox was tested on **Linux** (Ubuntu 20) x64, and **macOS** BigSur (Intel) machines, with python **3.7.5**.
     * You will need to install gcc for the compilation. You can install gcc 11 on macOS through [homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/gcc).
     * Fell free to reach me if you want binaries for either Ubuntu or BigSur
 
 6. You can also run the [MATLAB version](https://github.com/LAVI-USP/DBT-Reconstruction) of the toolbox.

## Toolbox manual:

You can find the [manual](https://github.com/LAVI-USP/DBT-Reconstruction/wiki/Toolbox-Manual) from the MATLAB version, which is pretty much the same. I will create a specific one for the python version in the future.
